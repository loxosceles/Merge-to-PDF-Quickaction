# Merge to PDF (MacOS Quickaction)

This is a simple script to merge multiple files of different format into PDF
file inside the same directory. It is designed to be used as a Quick Action in
MacOS. You can paste this into Automator and set it to run as a Quick Action. It
will then appear under the Services menu when you right-click on files in
Finder. This Quick Action will not pop up a window, it will just run and save
the file under a default name.
